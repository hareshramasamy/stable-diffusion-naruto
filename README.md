# Naruto Text-to-Image Generator

This project is a full-stack Generative AI web application that enables users to generate Naruto-style anime images from text prompts using a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model. The application features a user-friendly **Streamlit** front-end and a PyTorch-based back-end powered by Hugging Face's `diffusers` library.

The model was fine-tuned on the **Naruto BLIP-captioned dataset**, where only the **U-Net** component of the Stable Diffusion architecture was updated. The **CLIP tokenizer**, **VAE encoder**, and **VAE decoder** were kept frozen to retain the generalization ability of the pre-trained components.
